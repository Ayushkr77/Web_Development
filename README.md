# Full Stack Web Development ‚Äì Learning Journey 

Welcome to my documentation of essential web development concepts I've learned and practiced. This journey covered key backend and frontend topics, focusing on how modern web applications are built, structured, and connected. Below is a brief overview of each concept.

---

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. **Asynchronous JavaScript**
- Learned how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.
- Explored the Event Loop and how non-blocking code works in JS.

### 2. **Promises**
- Understood the Promise lifecycle (`pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`).
- Practiced chaining with `.then()` and error handling using `.catch()` and `try...catch`.

### 3. **DOM Manipulation**
- Manipulated HTML elements using JavaScript (e.g., `getElementById`, `querySelector`).
- Handled DOM events like `click`, `input`, and `submit`.

### 4. **Node.js**
- Built backend logic using Node.js.
- Understood its non-blocking I/O model and used built-in modules like `fs`, `http`, and `path`.

### 5. **HTTP Protocol**
- Learned how HTTP works including request/response cycle, headers, status codes, and methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Debugged and analyzed HTTP requests using browser tools and Postman.

### 6. **Express.js**
- Set up routes, handled query/body parameters, and returned JSON data.

### 7. **Middleware**
- Explored Express middleware functions for tasks like logging, body parsing, and error handling.
- Implemented custom middleware and understood the `next()` function.

### 8. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
- Understood what CORS is and how it prevents security issues.
- Used the `cors` middleware in Express to enable cross-origin requests from the frontend.

### 9. **Axios vs Fetch**
- Compared both methods for making HTTP requests:
  - `fetch()` is native to the browser but requires more boilerplate for error handling.
  - `axios` is a third-party library offering automatic JSON parsing and better error handling.

### 10. **Connecting Frontend to Backend**
- Connected frontend applications to backend APIs.
- Used `fetch` and `axios` to retrieve data from the server and display it on the UI.

### 11. **Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- Learned how JWTs work for stateless authentication.
- Created protected routes, generated tokens on login, and verified them using middleware.

### 12. **MongoDB & Mongoose**
- Used MongoDB as the NoSQL database to store application data.
- Interacted with MongoDB using Mongoose:
  - Created schemas and models.
  - Performed CRUD operations.
  - Validated and structured data effectively.

- Understood the importance of asynchronous programming in real-time applications.
- Gained practical experience in building and connecting full stack applications.
- Learned how to manage user authentication and secure API routes.
