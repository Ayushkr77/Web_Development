The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or text content.

Why DOM??
The DOM abstracts the structure of the document into a tree of objects, allowing scripts to manipulate the content and structure dynamically. This abstraction enables more complex interactions and functionalities beyond just static HTML

Static HTML
As the name suggests, static HTML represents HTML that does not change

Dynamic HTML
Fetching, Updating, Deleting, Adding elements, More complex elements

Fetching elements: querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementById, getElementByClassName
