Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle by either calling the next() function in the call stack, or by calling the end() function on the response object.
- Call the next() function in the call stack to pass control to the next middleware function.
